### RSA
1. When encrypting, you use their public key to write message and they use their private key to read it. When signing, you use your private key to write message's signature, and they use your public key to check if it's really yours. [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/454069)
1. If I have a message that I want to sign, I don't sign the message itself but I create a hash of it and then sign that hash by using my private key -> The signature gets attached to the message and both are transferred to the recipient -> The recipient recalculates the hash of the message and then uses my public key to verify the signature he received [stackexchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/9896)

### JWT
-

### HTTPS 
- Certificate Authorities (CA) creates a Certificate based on **digital signature** (generated by CA) + **Certificate Signing Request** + **Public Key**
- Establishing secured connection requires 2 steps - Certificate validation and Session Key exchanging
- 1st: server sends the Certificate with Public Key -> client validates the Certificate trying decrypt digital signature using Root-Certificates
- 2nd: client creates 2 copies of **Session Key** -> client sends one copy of Session Key ecrypted by servers' Public Key back to the server -> server decrypts Session Key using its Private Key -> client and server use this Session Key to encrypt-decrypt request data
