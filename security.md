### RSA

### HTTPS
- Certificate Authorities (CA) creates a Certificate based on **digital signature** (generated by CA) + **Certificate Signing Request** + **Public Key**
- Establishing secured connection requires 2 steps - Certificate validation and Session Key exchanging
- 1st: server sends its Public Key + Certificate -> client validates the Certificate trying decrypt digital signature using Root-Certificates
- 2nd: client creates 2 copies of **Session Key** -> client sends one copy of Session Key ecrypted by servers' Public Key back to the server -> server decrypts Session Key using its Private Key -> client and server use this Session Key to encrypt-decrypt request data
