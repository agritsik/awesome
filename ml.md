### Supervised VS. Unsupervised [*](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/machine-learning-101/287/what_is_ml/1620/)
Given a machine learning problem, first of all, one can determine whether it is a supervised or unsupervised problem.
- In a **supervised learning task**, the data sample would contain a target attribute {y}y, also known as *ground truth*.
- In contrary to the *supervised learning task*, we do not have the *ground truth* in an **unsupervised learning task**.

### Big 3" machine learning tasks [*](https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms)
- **Regression** (e.g. Linear Regression, Regression Tree, Deep Learning) is the **supervised** learning task for modeling and predicting continuous, numeric variables. 
*Examples* include predicting real-estate prices, stock price movements, or student test scores.
- **Classification** (e.g. Logistic Regression, Classification Tree, Deep Learning) is the **supervised** learning task for modeling and predicting categorical variables. 
*Examples* include predicting employee churn, email spam, financial fraud, or student letter grades.
- **Clustering** is an **unsupervised** learning task for finding natural groupings of observations (i.e. clusters) based on the inherent structure within your dataset. 
*Examples* include customer segmentation, grouping similar items in e-commerce, and social network analysis.
